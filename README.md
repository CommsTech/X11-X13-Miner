Personal Miner Configurations
By CommsTech

This configuration was built as a USB rubber ducky program. Used to quickly and accurately install CPUMiner and Its configurations
to the destination computer. This program is not meant to be malicious as it is only used on my personal computers. Feel free to 
add, remove or modify the code to fit your mining needs. If you locate an Issue please let me know and I will correct it A.S.A.P. 
Thank you.

P.S. Donâ€™t forget to change the Run-X11-X64.bat or you will be mining for me.
